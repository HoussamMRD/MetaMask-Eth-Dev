💎 What is ERC-721? 💎

ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 Tokens are all unique.
One of the most known examples for an ERC-721 Token is Crypto Kitties (https://www.cryptokitties.co/), where each Cat is an unique ERC-721 Token. 😺
